# gm-control-api mesh configuration bootstrapping

All gm-control-api configuration is configured in YAML and then templated to JSON.

The current gm-control-api configuration bootstrapping is just to show an example service mesh, but the true power of Grey Matter is the advanced configuration of each sidecar using the Grey Matter Control API + CLI, so be sure to think about customizing routes, etc between services which talk to each other often. 

This deployment includes SPIRE deployed as a statefulset and a daemonset, and interacting with envoy over SDS.

## Overview

The overall structure of the mesh is as follows:

Each service has a 
- domain
- cluster
- listener
- proxy
- shared_rules
- and route

Which link a sidecar proxy to its service

Then, the edge node has the following

- all of the above, PLUS
- A domain (with TLS configured using your static client-facing certs)
- a route for each service (e.g. /services/dashboard/latest/)
- (a cluster?)

## YAML structure

All structure for bootstrapping the mesh is defined in `.Values.global.services` (this is the service list for which the services + edge service template is used) and `.Values.gmControlApi.init.objects` (this defines all the templates for the services and the high-level standalone objects).

The only requirement for `.Values.global.services` is that it is a list of service objects. A service object can include anything that you define, but it is set as the scope for the services template/mesh configuration init objects.

`.Values.gmControlApi.init.objects` defines the templates of objects which will be
1. Generated by Helm (templated using the global services list + set up as configmaps)
2. Mounted as configmaps in the gm-control-api-init Job
3. Created by the `bootstrap.sh` script when in uses the `greymatter` CLI to call the API.
