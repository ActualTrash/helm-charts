# Minikube

Minikube allows us to set up and test a Kubernetes cluster locally, which is useful for applying and testing out configurations before deployment.

## Tools

You will need the following tools, tested for both mac and linux for the following versions:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)@1.15.3
- [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)@1.3.1
- [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)@6.0.12
- [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)@2.14.3

## Setup Minikube

To launch a minikube cluster, run:

```sh
minikube start -p gm-deploy --memory 4096 --cpus 4
```

We specify 4gb of memory and 4 processors because the 10+ containers needed for Grey Matter and Helm will throw memory exceptions with the default 2gb and 2 processors. Specifying `-p gm-deploy` will create a new Kubernetes cluster and set the namespace to `gm-deploy`.

You should see the following output:

```sh
üòÑ  [gm-deploy] minikube v1.3.1 on Ubuntu 18.04
üî•  Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=4, Memory=4096MB, Disk=20000MB) ...
üê≥  Preparing Kubernetes v1.15.2 on Docker 18.09.8 ...
üöú  Pulling images ...
üöÄ  Launching Kubernetes ...
‚åõ  Waiting for: apiserver proxy etcd scheduler controller dns
üèÑ  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "gm-deploy
```

Going forward, when running minikube commands, you'll need to use the `-p` flag which runs commands against the appropriate VM profile being used.

For example:

```sh
minikube status -p gm-deploy
```

You should receive something like:

```sh
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubectl: Correctly Configured: pointing to minikube-vm at 192.168.99.100
```

If you don't then double check that you're using the `-p` flag with the correct profile string.

### Troubleshooting Launch

If you have an older version of Minikube and you receive errors when attempting to start `gm-deploy` then try the below steps.

#### OS X

```console
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/minikube
rm -rf ~/.minikube
brew update
brew cask reinstall minikube
minikube version
```

## Setup Helm

Before running Helm commands, we need to configure our Helm Tiller. This is the server which runs on our Kubernetes cluster and acts as a endpoint for our command line `helm` commands.

```sh
$ helm init
$HELM_HOME has been configured at /home/$USER/.helm.

Tiller (the Helm server-side component) has been installed into your Kubernetes Cluster.

Please note: by default, Tiller is deployed with an insecure 'allow unauthenticated users' policy.
To prevent this, run `helm init` with the --tiller-tls-verify flag.
For more information on securing your installation see: https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#securing-your-helm-installation
```

Then add the decipher repo to Helm using your LDAP credentials:

```sh
helm repo add \
  decipher https://nexus.production.deciphernow.com/repository/helm-hosted \
  --username <ldap username>\
  --password '<ldap password>'
```

## Configure Voyager Ingress

At this writing there is [an issue](https://github.com/appscode/voyager/issues/1415) specifying voyager ingress as a dependency, so we need to manually configure Voyager ingress locally before launching our Grey Matter cluster. This can be done with following commands:

```sh
export PROVIDER=minikube
helm repo add appscode https://charts.appscode.com/stable/
helm repo update
helm install appscode/voyager --name voyager-operator --version 10.0.0 \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set cloudProvider=$PROVIDER \
  --set enableAnalytics=false \
  --set apiserver.enableAdmissionWebhook=false
...
NOTES:
Set cloudProvider for installing Voyager

To verify that Voyager has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace=kube-system get deployments -l "release=voyager-operator, app=voyager"
```

You should see that the voyager-operator is now running in the namespace `kube-system`. See `docs/Ingress.md` for more information. Note that running `kubectl get ingresses` will not list voyager because it uses its own custom resource definition. Instead, use `kubectl get ingress.voyager.appscode.com --all-namespaces` to find it with kubectl. Describe ingress is also a useful command for debugging: `kubectl describe ingress.voyager.appscode.com -n <namespace> <ingress-name>`.

## Load Grey Matter charts

The local development versions of our charts can be found in `greymatter/requirements-dev.yaml`. We will need to rename this file to `requirements.yaml` so that Helm can find it. If you don't need to make changes to any subcharts and are ok using the charts hosted in Decipher's production repo, feel free to skip this next command:

`cp greymatter/requirements.yaml greymatter/requirements.backup.yaml && cp greymatter/requirements-dev.yaml greymatter/requirements.yaml`

Now we need to load our charts into our Helm server. This is done with `helm dep up`, which loads our charts and the dependencies of our charts into the Helm server. We specify the folder `greymatter` to load all the needed charts in the `greymatter/requirements.yaml` file. Helm looks for the specified charts and packages them into the `greymatter/charts` directory. Keep in mind that if you make any changes to subcharts, you will need to run `helm dep up` again.

```sh
$ helm dep up greymatter
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Unable to get an update from the "local" chart repository (http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts):
Get http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts/index.yaml: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8879: connect: connection refused
...Successfully got an update from the "decipher" chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "appscode" chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
Update Complete.
Saving 11 charts
Deleting outdated charts
```

Notice that Helm has added the directory `greymatter/charts` which is untracked by git. After installing dependencies it should have a bunch of tarballs.

*Note: if you make any changes to files other than `greymatter-*.yaml` you will need to run `helm dep up greymatter` again to update these charts in the cluster. However, in most cases we want to override default chart values with custom files only.*

## Configure Docker Secrets

Helm needs valid docker credentials to pull and run decipher docker containers. Enter in your docker creds into the secret `dockerCredentials` in `greymatter-custom-secrets.yaml`.

```yaml
  registry: docker.production.deciphernow.com
  email: firstname.lastname@deciphernow.com
  username: firstname.lastname@deciphernow.com
  password: yourNexusPassword
```

## Install Grey Matter

With our dependencies loaded, we're now ready to install Grey Matter. The following command writes out all templated files with values from `greymatter-custom.yaml`, `greymatter-custom-secrets.yaml`, `greymatter-custom-minikube.yaml`, and the default `values.yaml` in each chart directory. `greymatter-custom-minikube.yaml` takes precedence because it is included last in our helm install command. Specifying --name will give our Helm deployment the name `gm`.

```sh
$ helm install greymatter -f greymatter-custom.yaml -f greymatter-custom-secrets.yaml -f greymatter-custom-minikube.yaml --name gm
...
NOTES:
Grey Matter 2.0.0-dev has been installed.

gm deployed to namespace "default" at 06:56:56 on 09/11/06
```

It may take a few minutes for the installation to become stable. You can watch the status of the pods by running `kubectl get pods -w -n default`. Before attempting to view the Grey Matter dashboard you'll need to setup ingress in the next section.

We also have the option to specify:

- "--replace" will replace an existing deployment
- "--dry-run" will print all Kubernetes configs to stdout

We can run `helm ls` to see all our current deployments and `helm delete --purge $DEPLOYMENT` to delete deployments. If you need to make changes, you can run `helm upgrade gm greymatter -f greymatter-custom.yaml -f greymatter-custom-secrets.yaml -f greymatter-custom-minikube.yaml` to update your release in place.

```sh
NAME                    REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION     NAMESPACE  
gm                      1               Thu Sep 12 11:25:43 2019        DEPLOYED        greymatter-2.1.0-dev    1.0.2-dev       default
voyager-operator        1               Thu Sep 12 11:19:01 2019        DEPLOYED        voyager-10.0.0          10.0.0          kube-system
```

## Ingress

There are two pods which control our ingress:

- `edge` validates client-facing certificates, gets routing rules from gm-control-api
- `voyager-edge` is our ingress controller. Edge isn't exposed to the outside world, and in a real deployment we need to tie our cluster ingress to an IP address. This points to `edge`.

To hit our cluster, we can access voyager-edge:

```sh
$ minikube -p gm-deploy service --https=true voyager-edge
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| NAMESPACE   | NAME           | URL                              |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| default     | voyager-edge   | http://192.168.99.102:31581      |
|             |                | http://192.168.99.102:31975      |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
üéâ  Opening kubernetes service  default/voyager-edge in default browser...
üéâ  Opening kubernetes service  default/voyager-edge in default browser...
```

Then open up <https://192.168.99.102:31581> in your browser (notice the http**s**). You should be prompted for your Decipher localuser certificate and be taken to the dashboard. Once there, make sure all services are "green" and then pat yourself on the back -- you deployed Grey Matter to Minikube!!

## Debugging

To see the status of Kubernetes configs, you can access the Kubernetes dashboard running within the Minikube cluster with `minikube dashboard`

To debug the mesh, you can access the Envoy admin UI for the edge proxy by running:

```sh
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}' | grep ^edge) 8088:8001
```

Then open <http://localhost:8088>

## Install Grey Matter into MiniKube on an EC2

To run the Grey Matter Minikube setup in AWS you will need to spin up a ubuntu18 `t2.xlarge` EC2 instance. After ssh'ing into your instance, run the following commands to install dependencies:

```bash
# Install kubectl
sudo apt-get update
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.3/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v1.3.1/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/

# Install Helm
curl -LO https://git.io/get_helm.sh
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh --version v2.14.3

# add helpful aliases
alias minikube='sudo minikube'
alias helm='sudo helm'
alias kubectl='sudo kubectl'
```

Next, start up minikube. Note that --vm-driver is set to none because AWS EC2 is a virtual machine. There is no need to install a hypervisor like VirtualBox.
`minikube start --vm-driver=none --memory 4096 --cpus 4 -p gm-deploy`

We will need `socat` as a dependency of helm:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install socat`

You should be able to follow the next few instructions as detailed in the above sections. Note you can skip the "Load Grey Matter charts" step since we'll be pulling charts from Decipher's production repo:

- [Setup Helm](#setup-helm)
- [Configure Voyager Ingress](#configure-voyager-ingress)
- [Configure Docker Secrets](#configure-docker-secrets)


Next we need to create a few custom yaml files. Make sure you are inside the `helm-charts` repo and run the following commands to copy over config files:

```bash
scp -i <path-to-keyfile> greymatter-custom-secrets.yaml greymatter-custom.yaml greymatter-custom-minikube.yaml ubuntu@<public-dns>:/home/ubuntu
```

The next few steps are the same as a local Minikube deployment:

- [Configure Docker Secrets](#configure-docker-secrets)
- [Install Grey Matter](#install-grey-matter)
- [Ingress](#ingress)

After running the last step where you expose the voyager-edge service, note one of the two ports. We need to expose our instance port to the internet. In your AWS console, navigate to:

EC2 >> (Network & Security) Security Groups >> Minikube Security Group >> Ingress

Select the security group you're using and edit the following:

| Parameter      | Value                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**       | TCP                                                  |
| **Protocol**   | 30263 (the voyager-edge port from the previous step) |
| **Port Range** | Custom                                               |
| **Source**     | 0.0.0.0/0  (Accessible via the internet)             |

Select **Save**. Navigate back to the AWS instances dashboard and find the `IPv4 Public IP` column. You should be able to see the Grey Matter Dashboard at  `https://<public-ip>:<voyager-edge-port>`.
